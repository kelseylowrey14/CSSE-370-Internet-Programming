Phase #1
  Test Cases: (*Basically requirements of assignment, criteria*)
  
  (1.1) 2 HTMl pages (index & secondpage)
  (1.2) Links to connect index & secondpage to eachother
  (1.3) Headers on each page (h1, h2,...)
  (1.4) Images on each page
  (1.5) 3 External Links
  
  Notes: (*Things you learned, issues, what you looked up even easy stuff.*)
    I thought that the h1, h2, h3 was just the different heading numberings but they made the header size vary. 
    
To make your pages open up to another window instead of redirecting it target = "_blank 


Phase #2
 
 All previous tests passed, added new tests

Test Cases:
    (2.1) Separate CSS File
    (2.2) 10 Selectors (Must include the following: Tag Selectors, ID, Class, Pseudoclass, Pseduoelements, Combinators)
    (2.3) Effects (Include the following: Sidebar, Display Focus, Change on Hover)
    
    Notes: Comments in CSS are /*   */
    Forms are like search bars <form class="example" action="/action_page.php" >
        <input type="text" placeholder="Search.." name="search2"></form>
